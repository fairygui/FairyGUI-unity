 FairyGUI for Unity
====

FairyGUI is a Cross Platform UI Editor & UI framework.
[Get FairyGUI-Editor](https://en.fairygui.com/product.html)  

Compared with traditional Unity UI engines such as NGUI and UGUI, FairyGUI uses a way of thinking closer to the designer to redefine the production process of the UI, which greatly reduces the time the programmer needs to invest in making the UI.<br>

In terms of running efficiency, FairyGUI uses the unique `FairyBatching` technology for DrawCall optimization, which is more efficient and easier to control than the traditional optimization techniques of NGUI and UGUI. <br>

In terms of functionality, FairyGUI has good built-in support for traditional UI production pain points, such as `rich text` (including image and animation), `emoji input` (direct support for keyboard), `virtual list`, `loop list`, `pixel-level hit test`, `curved UI`, `gesture`, `particles and model interspersed UI`, `typing effect`, etc. <br>

FairyGUI also fully encapsulates all input methods. Whether mouse, single touch, multi-touch, or VR handle input, developers can use the same code to handle interaction.<br>

The library was designed to work with Unity 5.6 and above, but is currently only tested with Unity 2018 and above.
